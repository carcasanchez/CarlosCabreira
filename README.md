Hi! I'm the former leader of the DuckDev team. In our latest project, A Link Between Ages, I have done a dual role as the team leader, organizing and focusing the team to end the game development as right as posible; and working as a gameplay programmer.   
 Is in this last half where I can show the most part of my contribution to the game. 
 
## Player movement 

 I have stablished the controls of the main caracter, making him live and walk.

## Collision System
 
 The entire collision system has been a task of mine: it has made possible all the collision interaction between entities, and delimiting player movement on the map.

## Entity behaviour (items and NPC's)

  I have programmed every entity in the game, like NPC's, chests, obstacles, usable items... and how them interact with the player

## Enemy IA

  Enemy behaviour (including the final boss) has also been my duty with is different attribute, patterns and interaction between player (damage and death).

   Also, I have created the Quest Manager System that we used to track events inside the game. You can check [its documentation page](https://carcasanchez.github.io/QuestManager/) to see how it works. It includes a step by step tutorial if you want to apply it to your project.
