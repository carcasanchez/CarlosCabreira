 Hi. I'm the former leader of the DuckDev team and I have been working in everything related to gameplay programming, being that: 
   * Player movement
   * Collisions System
   * Enemy IA
   * Entity system and functionality (items and npc's)
   
   Also, I have created the Quest Manager System that we used to track events inside the game. You can check [its documentation page](https://carcasanchez.github.io/QuestManager/) to see how it works. It includes a step by step tutorial if you want to apply it to your project.
